brython
=======

Brython (Browser Python) is an implementation of Python 3 running in the browser

Here is a simple example of an HTML page running Python :

    <html>
    <head>
    <script src="/brython.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body onload="brython()">
    <script type="text/python">
    from browser import document, alert

    def echo(ev):
        alert(document["zone"].value)

    document['mybutton'].bind('click',echo)
    </script>
    <input id="zone"><button id="mybutton">click !</button>
    </body>
    </html>

To use Brython, all there is to do is

1. load the script brython.js
2. run the function brython() on page load
3. write Python code inside tags `<script type="text/python">`

Main features
=============
Brython supports most of the syntax of Python 3, including comprehensions, generators, metaclasses, imports, etc. and many modules of the CPython distribution

It includes libraries to interact with DOM elements and events, and with existing Javascript libraries such as jQuery, 3D, Highcharts, Rapheal etc.

Getting started
===============
In the Releases section, load the latest version of the Brython site mirror, unzip it and start the built-in web server `server.py`. Point your browser to _http://localhost:8000_ and click on "site" : you access a clone of the [Brython site](http://brython.info) with an online editor, a console similar to the CPython interpreter, a gallery with many examples and a comprehensive documentation

Once you are familiar with the examples, create a new folder "app" at the same level as "site" and create a file "index.html" with the HTML example above. Point the browser to _http://localhost:8000/app_ to see the result
